### Hi dev!

I'm Igor Follador, passionate about technology and science!

I live in the northern region of the state of Rio Grande do Sul and am studying Computer Science at URI Erechim College.

I currently work with web development aimed at the ecommerce market and institutional pages, working on the entire flow of fullstack development of new features and deployment. I am very fascinated by the web area and the power of reach that it brings.

Seeking specialization as a software engineer...
