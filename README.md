### Hey there! I'm Igor Follador 👋

I'm a **Computer Scientist** from Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, passionate about **web** and **mobile development**. I graduated in **Computer Science** from **URI Erechim**, and I'm currently pursuing a specialization in **Fullstack Development** at **FIAP**.

### 🚀 What I Do
I'm all about building efficient, scalable applications, with a focus on solving real-world problems. Here's what I work with:

- **Backend Development**: PHP (mostly with Laravel) and Node.js (Express)
- **Frontend Development**: ReactJS (Vite/Next.js)
- **Mobile Development**: React Native, Flutter

### 🧑‍💻 My Passions
I'm a big fan of **Linux** – yeah, I'm one of those people who genuinely believe it’s always the solution. If something goes wrong, I just blame it on Windows! 😜 I'm also diving deeper into **AWS**, combining my love for coding with the challenge of handling infrastructure.
